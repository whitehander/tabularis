# Passwords in the Keychain, Queries in Three Languages

Two things in v0.6.0 aren't flashy, but they matter more than most feature launches. **System keychain integration** fixes the nagging security concern of storing database passwords in a config file. **Internationalization** makes Tabularis accessible in three languages from day one.

## The Problem with Stored Credentials

Until v0.6.0, connection credentials lived in a local JSON config file. Encrypted? No. Readable by any process with filesystem access? Yes. Acceptable for early prototypes, not acceptable for a tool that stores production database passwords.

v0.6.0 integrates with your operating system's native keychain:

- **macOS**: Keychain Access
- **Windows**: Windows Credential Manager
- **Linux**: libsecret / GNOME Keyring or KWallet

When you save a connection, the password goes to the keychain — not the config file. When you reconnect, Tabularis retrieves it through the OS secure API. You don't see the handoff; it just works.

API keys for AI providers follow the same pattern. Configure an OpenAI or Anthropic key in Settings and it lives in the keychain, never in a settings JSON file on disk.

## Three Languages

Tabularis v0.6.0 ships the full UI in **English**, **Italian**, and **Spanish**. Language detection is automatic based on your system locale, with a manual override in Settings.

Internationalization is unglamorous work — every string needs to be extracted, every plural form handled correctly, every date format adapted. But it's a multiplier: users who were blocked by a language barrier can now use the app.

More languages are planned. If you'd like to contribute a translation, the i18n files are straightforward JSON — no build step, no toolchain to set up.

## Tab Context Menu

A smaller addition from this release: right-clicking an editor tab opens a context menu with Rename, Close, Close Others, and Close All. The kind of polish that makes the editor feel like a proper application rather than a prototype.

## What This Signals

Neither keychain integration nor i18n is a shiny demo feature. They're infrastructure. Getting them right in v0.6.0 means future releases can focus on capabilities rather than catching up on correctness. That was the point.
