# Saved Queries

Tabularis lets you save SQL queries and associate them with a specific connection. Saved queries appear in the Explorer sidebar and can be executed, edited, or deleted with a single click.

## Saving a Query

There are two ways to save a query:

1. **From the Editor** — write or highlight a SQL statement in the editor, then click the **Save Query** button (or use the command palette). A modal opens where you give the query a name.
2. **From Query History** — open the Explorer's **History** tab, browse past executions for the active connection, and save any entry to promote it to a saved query.

The query is stored on disk alongside your connection profiles. Each saved query gets a unique UUID, and the SQL content is written to its own `.sql` file inside `{app_config_dir}/saved_queries/`. Metadata (name, filename, connection ID) is tracked in a central `meta.json` file.

## Browsing Saved Queries

Open the Explorer's **Favorites** tab. The saved-query list is separated from the schema tree and shows only the entries for the active connection.

Each entry displays the query name. Click once to select it; **double-click** to execute it immediately in a new editor tab.

## Executing a Saved Query

- **Double-click** the query in the sidebar, or
- **Right-click → Execute** from the context menu.

The SQL is loaded into a new editor tab and executed against the current connection. The tab title is set to the query name for easy identification.

## Editing a Saved Query

Right-click a saved query in the sidebar and choose **Edit**. The Query Modal opens pre-populated with the current name and SQL. Modify either field, then click **Save** to update both the metadata and the `.sql` file on disk.

## Deleting a Saved Query

Right-click → **Delete**. A confirmation dialog is shown before the query file and its metadata entry are removed.

## Per-Connection Isolation

Saved queries are scoped to a connection. When you switch the active connection in the sidebar, the Favorites tab updates automatically to show only the queries associated with that connection. This prevents accidental execution of a PostgreSQL query against a MySQL connection.

## Storage Format

| File | Location | Content |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `meta.json` | `{app_config_dir}/saved_queries/` | Array of `{ id, name, filename, connection_id }` |
| `{uuid}.sql` | `{app_config_dir}/saved_queries/` | Raw SQL text |

The `app_config_dir` follows the standard Tauri convention: `~/.config/dev.tabularis.app` on Linux, `~/Library/Application Support/dev.tabularis.app` on macOS, and `%APPDATA%\dev.tabularis.app` on Windows.
