# Getting Started

This guide walks you through the first things to do after installing Tabularis.

## 1. Create a connection

Click the **`+`** button in the left sidebar to open the New Connection form.

![Connection manager with connection form fields](/img/tabularis-connection-manager.png)

Fill in the required fields:

| Field | Notes |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Name** | A display label for the sidebar |
| **Driver** | Select `postgres`, `mysql`, or `sqlite` |
| **Host** | Hostname or IP address |
| **Port** | Pre-filled from the driver default (5432 for PostgreSQL, 3306 for MySQL) |
| **Database** | The database name |
| **Username** | Database user |
| **Password** | Stored in the OS keychain — never written to disk |

For SQLite, select the **sqlite** driver and use the file picker to choose your `.db` or `.sqlite` file. There is no host, port, or authentication.

### Test before saving

Click **Test** to verify the connection before saving. Tabularis makes a real connection attempt and returns the exact error message from the database engine if it fails. Click **Save** once the test succeeds.

### SSH tunnel

If your database is in a private network, enable the **SSH** tab before saving. Create an SSH profile (host, port, user, and either a password or a key file) and associate it with the connection. See [Connection Management](/wiki/connections) for details.

## 2. Explore the schema

Once connected, the Explorer opens on the **Structure** tab and shows schemas, tables, views, and routines for that connection. Expand any node to browse its children.

- **Double-click a table** to open it in the Data Grid and load the first page of rows.
- **Right-click a table** for schema actions: modify columns, add indexes, add foreign keys, view the ER diagram, dump, or generate SQL.
- Switch to **Favorites** to see saved queries for the active connection only.
- Switch to **History** to review previously executed SQL, grouped by date with search and quick re-run support.

For PostgreSQL connections with multiple schemas, use the schema selector in the sidebar header to control which schemas are visible. Your selection is persisted per connection.

## 3. Run a query

Click the **SQL Editor** tab or open a new editor tab. Type your SQL, then execute it with:

![SQL editor with query results in the data grid](/img/tabularis-sql-editor-data-grid.png)

| Action | macOS | Windows / Linux |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Execute (editor) | `Cmd + Enter` | `Ctrl + Enter` |
| Execute (global) | `Cmd + F5` | `Ctrl + F5` |

If you have multiple statements in the editor and no text is selected, Tabularis prompts you to choose which statement to run. Select text first to execute only that portion.

Results stream into the Data Grid below the editor. Use the page controls to navigate large result sets. The page size defaults to 500 rows and can be changed via `resultPageSize` in [Configuration](/wiki/configuration).

### Query History

Every executed statement is recorded in the Explorer's **History** tab for the current connection. Double-click any history entry to reopen that SQL in the editor, or right-click it for actions like copy, run, run in a new tab, save as favorite, and delete.

History is isolated per connection, so a PostgreSQL session and a MySQL session keep separate timelines.

## 4. Edit data

Double-click any cell in the Data Grid to edit it inline. Modified cells are highlighted. When you are ready, click **Commit** to generate and execute the `UPDATE` statements using the table's primary key. Click **Discard** to revert all pending changes.

## 5. Export results

Right-click on the Data Grid result to export the current result set to **CSV** or **JSON**. Large exports are streamed and can be cancelled.
