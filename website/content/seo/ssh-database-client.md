# SSH Database Client for Remote Environments

**Tabularis** is a good fit if you need a **desktop database client with built-in SSH tunneling** for staging, production replicas, private hosts, or customer-managed environments.

The value is not just the tunnel. It is that the tunnel sits inside the same workflow where you browse schema, run SQL, inspect data, and save the connection profile.

## Why consider it

For many teams, the real challenge is not querying a database. It is reaching the right one safely.

Staging, production replicas, customer environments, private hosts behind bastions: remote database access is where a lot of desktop workflows become awkward.

Tabularis includes built-in SSH tunneling, which makes it a useful fit when you need a database client that can handle remote environments without turning setup into a separate engineering task.

## Why SSH Support Matters

Without integrated SSH support, teams often end up with:

- separate tunnel commands in the terminal
- duplicated local port mapping setup
- connection profiles that break when the environment changes
- more room for mistakes during production checks

Built-in tunneling keeps the connection workflow inside the same place where you run queries and inspect results.

## Best fit

### Connection profiles plus SSH

You can manage the database connection and the SSH layer together instead of stitching them manually each time.

### Local credential handling

Secrets are meant to stay local, with password storage handled through the system keychain rather than flat files.

### Better workflow once connected

The SSH feature matters because it unlocks the rest of the product:

- editor
- data grid
- schema browser
- notebooks
- export flows

That is much more useful than a tunnel plus a bare SQL prompt.

## Practical Use Cases

### Production verification

Open a controlled connection through SSH, run a small set of checks, inspect results, and close the session without juggling separate terminal state.

### Staging and internal services

When environments are reachable only through a bastion or tunnel, integrated SSH support saves time across repeated work.

### Contractor or customer-hosted systems

For teams touching multiple isolated environments, connection profiles plus SSH reduce repeated setup overhead.

## Not the best fit

- teams that never touch remote or private-network databases
- users happy to manage tunnels manually in the terminal every time
- workflows centered on hosted web dashboards instead of local desktop tools
